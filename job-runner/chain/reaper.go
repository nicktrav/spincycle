// A JobReaper handles jobs and chains that have finished running.
//
// The chain's current state (running as normal, stopped, or suspended) influences
// how jobs are handled once they finish running, and how the chain is handled
// once there are no more jobs to run. There are different implementations of
// the JobReaper for each of these cases - a running, stopped, or suspended chain.
type JobReaper interface {
	// Run reaps done jobs from doneJobChan, saving their states and enqueing
	// any jobs that should be run to runJobChan. When there are no more jobs to
	// reap, Run finalizes the chain and returns.
	Run()

	// Stop stops the JobReaper from reaping any more jobs. It blocks until

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------
// JobReapers:
//  Each JobReaper implementation embeds a "reaper" struct with fields and methods
//  that all implementations use. In general, each reaper loops over doneJobChan,
//  receving jobs as they finish running, until there are no more jobs running.
//  Then the reaper finalizes the chain by sending some information about its state
//  to the Request Manager.
//
//  The RunningChainReaper is used for normally running chains - in the typical
//  case, this is the only reaper that will be used in the traverser. When a job
//  finished running and is sent to doneJobChan, the RunningChainReaper checks its
//  state and handles retrying the sequence if it failed or starting the next jobs
//  in the chain running if it completed. Once the chain is done (no more jobs are
//  or can be run), the reaper sends the chain's final state to the Request Manager.
//
//  The SuspendedChainReaper is switched out for the RunningChainReaper when the
//  traverser receives a signal that this Job Runner instance is shutting down.
//  It waits for all currently running jobs to finish and then determines whether
//  the chain is done (can any more jobs be run?). If the chain is done, the reaper
//  sends its final state to the Request Manager. In the more likely case that the
//  chain is NOT done, the reaper sends a SuspendedJobChain, containing all the info
//  required to later resume the chain, to the Request Manager.
//
//  The StoppedChainReaper is switched out for the RunningChainReaper when a user
//  requests that a currently-running chain be stopped. It waits for all currently
//  running jobs to finish and then sends the chain's final state (most often,
//  failed) to the Request Manager.
